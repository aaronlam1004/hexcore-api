# Hexcore API

This was created because Riot's current API does not support the new sets since they are not currently supported by Riot Games.

## Web Service
API server (including basic documentation) can be found/used here: https://hexcore-api.herokuapp.com/

You can use the demo tool at: https://hexcore-api.herokuapp.com/demo

## Current Sets Supported
- Set 6: Gizmos and Gadgets
- Set 6.5: Neon Nights
- Set 7: Dragonlands

## TODOs

- [ ] Better styling for web demo
- [ ] Proper logo/icon
- [ ] Add previous set APIs
